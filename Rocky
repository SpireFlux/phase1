What'd you say?
Did these guys teach you to

Don't you never say that --
-- You guys talk like that in

guys are scum.
Don't ya never come round this
girl -- Go home.
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent
ya face!
How come ya wanna hang out
with those guys?  They teach
ya bad things.
Hey!  When I was your age,
there was only one girl who
talked like that in the whole
neighborhood.
Make your teeth yella --
Makes your breath like garbage.
Nobody likes garbage --
Anyway, this girl with the
dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin',
but the guys wouldn't take her
out for any serious datin'.
'Cause that's the way guys
are -- They laugh when ya talk
dirty.  They think ya cute for
a while, but then ya getta
reputation an' watch out.
Nobody's ever gonna take ya
serious.  Ya get no respect
I gotta use a bad word --
Whore.  You'll end up maybe
becomin' a whore.
That doesn't matter -- You
don't really have to be a
whore, just act like one an'
that's it.
Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty
years from now people will say
'D'you remember Marie?' 'No,
who was she?' 'She was that
little whore who hung out at
the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh,
now I remember!'... See, they
don't remember you, they
remember the rep.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
What was I gonna say?
Ya, somethin' like that.
'Night, Marie.
... Yeah, who're you to give
advice, Creepo.
Paulie's sister.
She ain't retarded, she's shy.

Yeah.
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo."""
